# ArduinoPendulums

This project was developed during Covid-19 alert quarantine. At that time I was still a BSc student and I was asked to build a homemade simple and compound pendulum to complete my "Physics 1" course labs so I could access the test. Obviously professor didn't ask to build an Arduino automized swing period calculator but, ehi, I was on the way to get an engineering degree. I. DO. THE. CODE.   
   
Experiment: boring 👎   
Set-up: fun 👍   
Professor gave me 2 bonus points to spend in the final test 😎   

## How does it work

It's actually pretty simple. I used a magnet as pendulum mass and a induction megnetic sensor was placed in the lowees point where it could detect any swing. Since the problem statement asked to calculate the avarage swing time period of the first 10 swings I had to implement a check when the pendulum swings were enough short to keep the sensor cosntantly triggered.
